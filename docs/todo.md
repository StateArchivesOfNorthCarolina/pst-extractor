# Ideas for Future Work

- [Version 0.0.1](https://github.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina/tomes-pst-extractor/commit/d3e8e6fe87da2048947370bdae0522e9b3298128#diff-34cffdae1474e839ffac88fe019a0155) of this software wrote email folders in a flat (non-nested) structure using the internal `PstId` value. It also created a `.tsv` file that contained a mapping between the `PstId` and the actual folder path. This appears to have been done to avoid issues with illegal path characters and subsequently a `-tt` flag was added to TOMES DarcMail in order to notate the actual folder names in an EAXS file. Consider adding this feature back as an option. Also consider doing this by default if, upon inspecting the actual folder names, the program learns that the resulting folder path will exceed the path character limit for the given operating system.
- While the program currently removes from consideration an folder starting with "delete" (case insensitive) also consider automatically removing any folder that starts with "spam".
	- These types of exclusions may need to become optional if it's determined that doing so may contradict certain types of archival practice.
- Consider adding the option to use `readpst` instead of MailBee. This should really just amount to having a True/False switch in the constructor and then changing the value of `@self.extractor_app` to be `readpst` instead of the MailBee `.exe` file.
	- If you want to support a user changing `readpst` options you might simply want to add \*args/\**kwargs options to either the constructor or the `@self.extract()` method. In other words, you would pass those to the `readpst` syntax. This approach might also be useful if you continue to add command line options to the MailBee `.exe` file.
